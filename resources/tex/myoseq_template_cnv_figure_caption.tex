The y-axis denotes the copy number as inferred by gCNV, and the X axis shows the position along the gene in kilobases. The blue line represents this sample of interest, and the grey lines represent the other samples in the batch of CNV calling. The black dots on the plot represent a probe for exon capture, which roughly represent exons. The copy number estimation is expected to hover around 2.0 for autosomes. For the X chromosome, the copy number estimation should hover around 2.0 for females and 1.0 for males.
